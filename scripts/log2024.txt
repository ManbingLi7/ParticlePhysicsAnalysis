03.01.
#All analysis scripts and data of BeP8 is copied to 1TStorage (updated until 03.Jan)
#All analysis scripts and thesis copied to $HOME/BeAnalysis (updated untill 03.Jan)
(Please updata again at 01.Feb)

03.01
#modified MC histogram weights to weight_flux(this was by mistake used weight = 1, which is wrong)
#run script make_beta_eventsatHighR.py to generate the tuned beta at high R histogram for N, C, Li, B
#run script generate_masshist_iss.py to get Carbon Rigidity resolution ISS -> compare with MC.

04.01
#modify plot, carbon, oxygen rig data-mc comparison with reference rigidity from beta
#run script make_beta_eventsatHighR.py to generate the tuned beta at high R histogram for N, C, Li, B
#write all information of calculating fluxes into txt files
#update script Be_MassFit_AllSteps_P8B1236.py using the latest massfunction version *GBLV2.py
#remove the related old scripts of Be_MassFit*
#update the Beta resolution plots with flux weight

In the whole week from 06.Jan to 13.01, I was mainly focused on presentations and only did useless things

13.01
#updated mc mass 2D-hist with flux weight
#compare the acc and corrections with Jiahui
#Re-run mc Pass8
#Run acceptance for Li and run other ingredients for Boron.
+compare counts before and after fits for MC Mix template fits 

14.01
+compare counts
+compare acceptance
+compare measuring time
+plot of TofBeta
+plots of interval range
+plots of comparison ( this-> Geneva)

all the comparison with Jiahui
the test with MCMix

30.01
#compare with Jiahui: need to update, re-run the data again
#rm some old scripts with Be_Templatefit (but there are still old versions in Achive )
#rm some old ipynb scripts with plot_counts* (but still kept in Achive)
#run the script with iss_counts to get the Li, Be counts vs R with preselection

To finish the average flux chapter:
#run data Boron
#run effficiency Li and Boron
#run lq1 efficiency jobs, run inntrk eff jobs for Li B (To do: should combine the efficiency of Li Be Boron in one job, so only need to be submitted once)
+plot acceptance and total efficiency Li, Be, B
+unfolding with rigidity resolution Li, Be, B

5.Feb
#plots of fit results range
#plots of rigidity cutoff cut with beta cutoff (to extract Li7 and Be10 from data)
6 Feb
Li7 mass Data/MC comparsion

8.Feb writing 
#ToF charge cut efficiency
#background reduction cut efficiency
#Unfolding 
#Be nuclei flux

9.Feb
#write the background cut efficiency, summary of the efficiency

10.Feb 
#write the unfolding of Be flux
#plots of rigidity resolution
#Run Lithium -> get lithium results

12.Feb
#beta cutoff for tof and NaF
 -combine data/mc in one script
 -run tof/naf/agl with different binning, for both data, mc 
#run lithiun fit counts, finish the efficiency corrections for lithium, lithium raw fluxes


19.Feb
#submit jobs for rerun efficiency for ISS, Be
-To do: submit for B, C, N, O MC
-run the background fragmentation for Li


24.Feb
move plot_rich_efficiency_comjiahui.py to Achive
